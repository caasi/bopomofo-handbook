<p>The content was required to include reference graphics of List of Bopomofo Alphabet, Ratio Reference between Chinese Character and Bopomofo, Specimen of Chinese Character with Bopomofo (portrait/landscape), Reference Table of Chinese Character with Bopomofo Syllables, to fulfill actual need of education and application onto computer typesetting for printing industry.</p>

<p>In order to deliver correct usage of Bopomofo in simplicity and clearness, this manual is mainly composed by graphics. Since the manual is about to be published, I simply note down this foreword to express my thankfulness to all the professors in my team. I also like to extend my appreciation to inspector, Mr. Yang, Yung-chuan, and assistance, Ms. Yang, Yu-wen, from Chinese Popularizing Committee for all their supports and coordination on administration issues.</p>
